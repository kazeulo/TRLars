# Technology Readiness Assessment for Commercialization Enhancement and Roadmapping (TRACER)

TRACER is an assessment and recommendation-support tool designed to systematically evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of innovations in the Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources (AANR) sector. The platform applies a structured readiness assessment framework and generates evidence-based, indicative recommendations to support the progression of technologies from research and development toward adoption and utilization.

Technologies are evaluated using defined criteria covering technology development status, intellectual property position, and technology transfer and commercialization-readiness initiatives, thereby supporting informed decision-making, standardized documentation, and strategic planning across stages of technology maturation.

## Key Features

### Structured TRL Assessment
Evaluate technology maturity across five critical readiness dimensions:

- **Technology Status** – Technical feasibility, validation, and development progress  
- **Market & Commercialization Status** – Market need, value proposition, and business readiness  
- **Intellectual Property Status** – IP ownership, protection, and freedom-to-operate considerations  
- **Industry Adoption Status** – Partner interest, pilot usage, and ecosystem alignment  
- **Regulatory & Compliance Status** – Standards, certifications, and regulatory readiness  

### Actionable Recommendations
- Generates **tailored insights** based on assessment results  
- Highlights **gaps, risks, and next steps** required to advance TRL maturity  

### AI-Powered Insights
- Integrates **Hugging Face models** to produce adaptive, human-like guidance  
- Supports consistent, explainable recommendation generation

## Purpose & Vision

This project is designed to **bridge the gap between innovation and market readiness**.

Many promising technologies fail not due to technical weakness, but due to unclear commercialization pathways. This tool provides clarity by helping users:

- Understand their current TRL position  
- Identify missing readiness components  
- Make informed decisions on development, validation, and deployment
